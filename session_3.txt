## Session Summary

This session focused on implementing and debugging the data normalization and reconciliation pipeline.

### Phase 1: Integration of Name Variation Logic

1.  **Goal**: Integrate the new name variation utilities into the `update_db` command.
2.  **Actions Taken**:
    - Modified `handle_name_variations.py` to update a product's `name_variations` field directly and add the discovery to a `name_variation_hotlist.json`.
    - Updated the `Product` model to include a `name_variations` JSONField to store `(name, store)` tuples.
    - Created and applied the necessary database migration for the model change.
    - Modified `update_products_from_inbox.py` to orchestrate the post-update process: reading the hotlist, finding and merging duplicates, and regenerating the `product_name_translation_table.py`.

### Phase 2: Refactoring Normalization Logic

1.  **Goal**: Refactor the brand cleaning logic for better modularity.
2.  **Actions Taken**:
    - Created a new, dedicated utility: `api/utils/normalization_utils/get_cleaned_brand.py`.
    - Moved all brand synonym and rule-based cleaning logic into this new file.
    - Modified `get_normalized_string.py` to call this new utility.

### Phase 3: Debugging `UNIQUE` Constraint Errors

1.  **Problem Encountered**: After the changes, running `update_db` began failing with `UNIQUE constraint failed` errors, first on `normalized_name_brand_size` and then on `barcode`.
2.  **Investigation**:
    - We diagnosed the `normalized_name_brand_size` error as a side-effect of the new `.save()` call in `handle_name_variations`, which was invalidating the script's cache of existing strings. The user resolved this by wiping the database to start fresh.
    - A new `UNIQUE constraint failed: products_product.barcode` error then appeared.
3.  **Debugging Actions**:
    - Added a `try...except` block to `batch_create_new_products.py` to catch the error.
    - Refined the debugging logic to work within a failed database transaction, using in-memory data to find the conflict.
4.  **Discovery**: The debugging output revealed the conflict was caused by multiple products having the barcode string `'notfound'` within the same batch.

## Relevant File Paths

- `C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\api\scrapers\scrape_and_save_iga.py` (The IGA scraper runner)
- `C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\api\utils\scraper_utils\clean_raw_data_iga.py` (The cleaning utility for IGA data)
- `C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\api\utils\normalization_utils\clean_barcode.py` (The utility that should be removing `'notfound'`)
- `C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\api\utils\database_updating_utils\batch_create_new_products.py` (Where the database insertion fails)

## Current Problem Description

We are currently at a logical impasse.

1.  **The Error**: The `update_db` command is failing because multiple new products from the IGA scraper have the barcode `'notfound'`, which violates the database's `UNIQUE` constraint.
2.  **The Code**: The `clean_raw_data_iga.py` script, which processes the IGA data, correctly calls the `clean_barcode()` utility. The `clean_barcode()` utility is correctly written to find the string `'notfound'` and convert it into a `None` value. A `None` value would be ignored by the `UNIQUE` constraint and would not cause this error.
3.  **The Contradiction**: The code we are looking at shows that it's impossible for the string `'notfound'` to be passed to the database, yet the error proves that it is happening. Given that you have confirmed the bytecode cache (`__pycache__`) was also cleared, the reason for this discrepancy between the code's logic and its runtime behavior is currently unknown.

i think i've fixed this now. I changed an import to be explicit and it seems to be working. 
 nope its still broken:

  - Name: John West Tuna Onion & Tomato 98% Fat Free

so the problem is the barcode. for each store file the barcodes should be unique. However the database updater is processing multiple store files at once. So there will certainly be duplicates. 
it should therefor be checking for duplicates as it makes it caches. 

C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\api\management\commands\update_db.py

so i have a solution. We are going ot move to processinng one jsonl file at a time. This should make the logic a lot simpler and less prone to errors. It will be slower but that is my solution that i want to try.
