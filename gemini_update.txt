## Data Pipeline Flow

This section outlines the standard workflow for collecting, processing, and archiving data.

### Step 1: Discover and Add Stores

1.  **Find Stores:** Use the `find_stores` command to discover store locations for a specific company.
    ```bash
    python manage.py find_stores --company <company_name>
    ```
2.  **Update Database:** Use the `update_db` command to add the newly discovered stores to the database.
    ```bash
    python manage.py update_db --stores
    ```

### Step 2: Scrape Product Data

*   **Scrape:** Use the `scrape` command to fetch product data for the stores of a specific company.
    ```bash
    python manage.py scrape --<company_name>
    ```

### Step 3: Process Raw Data

*   **Process:** Use the `process_raw_data` command to process the raw JSON files generated during scraping.
    ```bash
    python manage.py process_raw_data
    ```

### Step 4: Update Database with Products

*   **Update:** Use the `update_db` command again, this time to populate the database with the processed product and price information.
    ```bash
    python manage.py update_db --products
    ```

### Step 5: Analyze Data (Optional)

*   **Analyze:** Use the `analyze_data` command to generate reports, charts, and heatmaps to gain insights from the collected data.
    ```bash
    # Example: Generate a product overlap heatmap for all companies
    python manage.py analyze_data --report company_heatmap

    # Example: Generate a store-level heatmap for a specific company
    python manage.py analyze_data --report store_heatmap --company-name "Woolworths"
    ```

### Step 6: Generate Archives

1.  **Company Archives:** Use the `build_company_jsons` command to create company-level data archives.
    ```bash
    python manage.py build_company_jsons
    ```
2.  **Store Archives:** Use the `build_store_jsons` command to create store-level data archives.
    ```bash
    python manage.py build_store_jsons
    ```
