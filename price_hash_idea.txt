 Pre-Calculating a "Data Hash"

  This is another optimization that would specifically speed up updates and re-runs.

   1. Local: For each price record in the file, the local machine would calculate a "hash" (a unique signature, like an MD5 hash) of all
      its data—the price, the unit size, the special status, etc. This hash would be added to the file.
   2. Server: When the server is about to update an existing price, it would first compare the hash from the file with a hash stored on
      the database record.
       * If the hashes match, it means the data hasn't changed at all, and it can skip the update entirely for that record.
       * If the hashes are different, it performs the update.

  This would make re-processing the same file, as in your earlier example, a true "no-op" from a database write perspective, making it
  incredibly fast.

  These two ideas work very well together. The "pre-resolution" of IDs would make the whole process architecturally simpler and
  faster, while "hashing" would make updates to existing data hyper-efficient.
