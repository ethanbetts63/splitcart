**Plan for Refactoring Store Scrapers**

1.  **Create a `discovered_stores` Directory:**
    *   A new directory named `discovered_stores` will be created at the root of the `api/data` directory. This directory will serve as an "inbox" for the raw, unprocessed store data from the scrapers.

2.  **One File Per Store with Company Prefix:**
    *   Each store scraper (`find_aldi_stores.py`, `find_coles_stores.py`, etc.) will be modified to output one JSON file per discovered store.
    *   The filename for each store will be prefixed with the company name and the store's unique ID (e.g., `coles_7730.json` for a Coles store).

3.  **Standardized Store Schema:**
    *   A new set of utility functions, similar to `clean_raw_data_coles.py`, will be created for each store scraper. These functions will be responsible for transforming the raw store data into a standardized schema that matches the `Store` model in `companies/models/store.py`.
    *   The standardized JSON files will be saved to the `discovered_stores` directory.

4.  **Metadata in Each File:**
    *   Each JSON file will contain a `metadata` section with overarching information that the database updater will need, such as the `company`, `brand`, and the date and time of the scrape.

5.  **`update_store_database` Management Command:**
    *   A new management command, `update_store_database`, will be created.
    *   This command will iterate through the JSON files in the `discovered_stores` directory.
    *   For each file, it will read the standardized store data and create or update the corresponding `Store` object in the database.
    *   After a file has been successfully processed, it will be deleted from the `discovered_stores` directory.

6.  **Decoupling Scrapers and Database Updater:**
    *   The store scrapers will no longer be responsible for updating the database directly. Their sole responsibility will be to find and standardize store data and save it to the `discovered_stores` directory.
    *   The `update_store_database` command will be the only part of the system that interacts with the `Store` model in the database.
