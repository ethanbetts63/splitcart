Here is a summary of the work we completed in this session.

### Part 1: Test Suite Health and Factory Refactoring

Our first focus was on fixing several failing tests and improving the test infrastructure.

- **`VariationManager` Tests**: We fixed a series of errors, including an `AttributeError` from a class refactor and a `KeyError` from an outdated test data structure. This led to the key insight that our model factories needed to be updated to handle fields that are auto-generated by the model's `save()` method.
- **Other Test Fixes**: We fixed a `TypeError` in the `UpdateOrchestrator` tests and an `AssertionError` in the `ColesBarcodeScraper` tests.
- **Model Factory Overhaul**: To solve the testing problems, we significantly improved `products/tests/test_helpers/model_factories.py`.
    - We added new factories for our newer models (`ProductBrand`, `BrandPrefix`, etc.).
    - We overrode the `_create` method in `ProductFactory` and `ProductBrandFactory`. This allows tests to directly specify values for normalized fields, bypassing the model's automatic `save()` logic and making the tests much cleaner and more reliable.

### Part 2: Designing the Substitution System

We had a detailed discussion about the architecture of the upcoming product substitution system.

- **Problem Analysis**: We discussed the challenges of matching products with no brand (like fruit and veg) and correctly handling home-brand products (like Coles vs. Woolworths brands).
- **Substitution Levels**: We defined a clear, four-level framework for classifying different types of substitutions (e.g., same product/different size, different brand/similar product, etc.).
- **Modeling**: We decided on the best way to represent these relationships in the database. We opted for a single, flexible `ProductSubstitution` model rather than multiple rigid ones. I then implemented the required changes to this model, adding `type` and `score` fields to classify the substitutions, and successfully migrated the database.

### Part 3: Implementing and Debugging the Substitution Engine

We built the first stage of the substitution engine and then debugged and improved it based on the initial results.

- **Level 1 Generator**: I created the `BaseSubstitutionGenerator` and the `Lvl2SubstitutionGenerator` (for Level 1) and added a `generate_substitutions` management command to run them.
- **Quality Analysis Tool**: To measure our progress, I built an `analyze_substitutions` command. This tool provides overall statistics, hub analysis for finding problem products, and random sampling for manual review.
- **Debugging the Level 1 Generator**: The analysis tool immediately revealed that the initial heuristic for finding size variants (a simple "first three words" rule) was flawed and producing many incorrect matches.
- **Refactoring the Level 1 Generator**: Based on your direction, I replaced the flawed logic with a much more robust approach that uses the `thefuzz` library to compare the string similarity of `normalized_name` fields, yielding far more accurate results.

### Part 4: Bug Fixing and System Hardening

We diagnosed and fixed several deeper bugs in the data processing pipeline that were revealed during our work.

- **`BrandManager` `UNIQUE` Constraint Failures**: We diagnosed and fixed a recurring crash during the `update_db` process. 
    - We initially believed the issue was duplicates within a single batch.
    - When that fix was insufficient, we diagnosed the true root cause: a mismatch between the database's `UNIQUE` constraint (on `name`) and the application's logic (which was checking for existence using `normalized_name`).
    - Following your insight, we implemented a superior design by making `normalized_name` the unique key on the `ProductBrand` model and completely refactoring the `BrandManager` to robustly handle brand variations. This made the brand logic consistent with the product logic.
- **Log Noise**: We tracked down and removed several noisy `print` statements from the reconciliation process that were cluttering the logs, finally locating them in the `ProductReconciler`.

### Part 5: Refining the Normalization Pipeline

Finally, we diagnosed and fixed a critical bug in the data pipeline that was preventing the new substitution generator from working.

- **Problem Diagnosis**: After refactoring the `Lvl2SubstitutionGenerator`, it produced zero results. You correctly diagnosed that this was because the `normalized_name` field was not being calculated and saved during the initial scraping phase; it only existed within the database, not in the intermediate `.jsonl` files.
- **Improving `ProductNormalizer`**: We identified that for similarity matching, we needed a new kind of normalization (lowercase, no punctuation, but with spaces preserved). I added a new `get_fully_normalized_name()` method to the `ProductNormalizer` to produce this.
- **Updating the Data Cleaners**: I updated the data cleaner class for all four scrapers (Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, IGA) to use this new method, ensuring the `.jsonl` files are now generated with the correct `normalized_name` needed for the substitution engine.
- **Bug Fix**: We also found and fixed an `AttributeError` in the `BaseDataCleaner` that was caused by a typo in a method name.

### Part 6: Implementing Size Merging Logic

We addressed a crucial data enrichment gap related to product sizes.

- **Problem Diagnosis**: We identified that the `sizes` list from incoming scraped products was being discarded when a product match was found in the database. This led to data loss and missed opportunities for better substitution matching.
- **Solution Implementation**: I implemented logic in `UpdateOrchestrator._process_consolidated_data` to intelligently merge the `sizes` list from incoming products with the `sizes` list of existing products. This combines all known size variations for a product.
- **Database Persistence**: I ensured that the `sizes` field is correctly included in the `UnitOfWork.commit`'s `bulk_update` operation, so these merged size lists are saved to the database.
- **Confirmation**: We confirmed that these changes are all that's needed to get the size merging working, making product size data much richer and more accurate for substitution purposes.
