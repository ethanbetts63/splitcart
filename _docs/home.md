## Founder's Letter
**Title:** What percentage of a whole chicken is bone weight?
**Subtitle:** Short answer: **25-32%**. Most common answer: **Who cares?**

**Content:**
**I care.** And if you're like me then you care too. If you're like me, you've considered the dollar value of a rewards point. Or weighed the merits of ply count versus the per kilo price of toilet paper.

**If you're like me then SplitCart was built for you.** I know this to be a fact because I built SplitCart for me.

The idea is simple. Why not buy each item in my shopping list from the store where it's cheapest? Because you don't know the price of every item in every store. Because you'd never go to ten stores on one shopping run. Because it would be a hassle.

I've collected the prices. I've mathematically calculated the best two, three, or four store combinations, and I've removed as much hassle as humanly possible.

So, welcome aboard fellow bargain hunter. I hope SplitCart can be as useful to you as it is to me. **Expect to save 10-15%** on your grocery bill!

If you have questions, suggestions or anything else I'd love to hear from you.

Happy hunting,

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Title:** The Hard Hitting Questions
*Image: King Kong swatting at discount planes (king_kong.webp)*

### Will I really save 10-15%?
Hopefully! Our optimization aims to find the maximum possible savings. But it's restricted by the stores you choose, the items in you select and the substitutes you approve. Some shopping lists have more potential for savings than others, so individual results will vary but we find that 10-15% is a consistant average.

### What’s a ‘substitute’ and why does it matter?
A substitute is a product you would be willing to have "instead of" the original product you choose. For example, a different brand of the same type of milk. Including substitutes gives our algorithm a lot more options to play with and is a major factor in the savings you should expect. We know it's an annoying to do but it's also the reason we can save you more than any other comparison site.

### Is it always cheaper than buying from one store?
Splitting your cart is almost always cheaper, almost. Our results will always show you the "Best Single Store" option alongside the split-cart options, so you can clearly see if splitting your cart provides a real benefit for your specific shopping list.

### Which stores can I compare?
Right now, SplitCart supports Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, and IGA. We’d love to bring the smaller guys on board too, but their price data is harder to track down — which hurts, because they’re often the real discount heroes.

### How accurate are the prices?
The short answer is: pretty accurate! But not perfect. We pull prices directly from stores websites as often as we can but we can only be as accurate as the stores themselves.

### How can it be free?
Honestly? We're just getting started. Right now SplitCart has no users to speak of, which means there's no point even thinking about monetisation yet. The focus is entirely on building something genuinely useful. Once there's a real user base, we'll figure out a model that doesn't compromise the product. Until then — enjoy it.
