We harvest them at the peak of their ripeness when they are bursting with flavour. Continental has been a part of Australian homes since the 1950s, when we first launched our iconic Chicken Noodle Soup. Since then, we have been consistently delivering Australians the soups they know and love.  Our Continental products are made with carefully selected ingredients. All of our vegetables, herbs and spices are grown in the field, ripened in the sun, and harvested in season \u2013 when they taste their best. Next, these ingredients are dried, which is the oldest known way of preserving food. At Continental, we\u2019ve always prided ourselves on the quality of what we produce, from sourcing the best quality ingredients to putting passionate and talented chefs in our kitchens. Now we\u2019re bringing this same passion for quality to our quest for sustainability, because food grown responsibly simply tastes better. This means reducing water consumption to produce our crops and protecting the environment and biodiversity in the areas surrounding our farms.
