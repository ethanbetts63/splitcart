okay so all three of these work. what i want to focus on is the warm up method. its common to all of them. effectively triggering the captcha on the site is the point. Then once that happens i solve it. Then our script detects that ive solved it. And then it closes the browser. but we have 3 slightly different versions now. i want to consolidate them into one util that they can all use. I think the product scraper is probably the primary one to copy from. but they are all incredibly similar.
