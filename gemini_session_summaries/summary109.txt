This session covered a wide range of backend bug fixes, frontend UI/UX improvements, and in-depth SEO analysis.

### 1. Backend Data Pipeline Bug Fixes

A series of crashes in the `update` management command were diagnosed and resolved:
*   **`AttributeError` in Group Maintenance:** Two identical `AttributeError: 'datetime.date' object has no attribute 'date'` errors were fixed. The issue was caused by unnecessarily calling `.date()` on an object that was already a `date`. The fix was applied to both `internal_group_health_checker.py` and `intergroup_comparer.py`.
*   **`decimal.InvalidOperation` in Price Manager:** A crash during price processing was traced to trying to convert a `None` value to a `Decimal`. This was resolved by adding a defensive check in `price_manager.py` to skip any price record where `price_current_val` is null.
*   **`FileNotFoundError` in Update Orchestrator:** The orchestrator was crashing when trying to delete a file that had already been removed. Both `os.remove()` calls in `update_orchestrator.py` were wrapped in `try...except FileNotFoundError` blocks to make the cleanup process more robust.
*   **Duplicate Barcode Investigation:** A `Duplicate entry` error for barcodes was investigated. The root cause was identified in the `ProductManager`'s resolution logic, which fails to handle duplicate products within a single file because its caches are not updated during the resolution loop. This finding was documented in `_product_update_process.txt`.

### 2. Frontend Improvements

*   **"See More" Button Enhancement:** The low-visibility "See more" text link on product carousels was replaced with a more prominent `shadcn/ui` `Button` component. The button now displays the text "Explore All Deals" with a right-arrow icon to improve user engagement, as implemented in `ProductCarousel.tsx`.
*   **Favicon Implementation:**
    *   The site's favicon was not displaying correctly. The issue was diagnosed as an incorrect file path in `index.html`.
    *   The SVG asset was moved from `src/assets` to the `public` directory, which is the standard Vite convention for static assets.
    *   The `<link>` tag in `index.html` was updated to point to the correct root path (`/favicon.svg`).
    *   A subsequent issue where the icon appeared "too small" was diagnosed as a problem with the SVG's internal `viewBox` and `transform` attributes. A plan to edit the SVG's code was formulated before the user resolved it.
*   **Pillar Page Rendering Error:** A `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `PillarPage.tsx` was investigated. The error was caused by unsafely accessing a nested `comparisons` array from an API response. A fix involving creating a local constant to help TypeScript's type narrowing was proposed before the user resolved it.

### 3. SEO Analysis and Implementation

*   **Homepage SEO Audit:** A full audit of the homepage was conducted. Key issues identified were missing meta tags (title/description), a non-descriptive `<h1>` heading, carousel titles not being proper `<h2>` headings, and a lack of page-level structured data (`Organization`, `WebSite`).
*   **Meta Tag Implementation:** The `useDocumentHead` hook was added to `HomePage.tsx` to set a user-specified, keyword-rich title and meta description. An initial implementation error that caused the title to display as `[object Object]` was diagnosed (object passed instead of strings) and corrected.
*   **Sitemap Strategy:**
    *   The existing sitemap was identified as inadequate, containing only the homepage.
    *   An investigation of `api/sitemaps.py` and `splitcart/urls.py` revealed an incomplete implementation.
    *   A full strategy was devised to create a dynamic, comprehensive sitemap. The plan includes correcting the URLs for the existing `PillarPageSitemap`, creating a new `ProductSitemap` that uses the latest price date for the `<lastmod>` tag, and registering the new sitemap in `urls.py`.
