This session focused on significant enhancements to both the frontend and backend of the SplitCart application.

  On the frontend, several improvements were made to enhance user experience and functionality. The "Next" button in the navigation
  bar is now conditionally displayed, appearing only on the home and search pages when the shopping trolley contains at least one
  item. Product carousels on the home page were visually grouped within a div featuring a muted background, padding, and rounded
  corners. The ProductTile component was made more compact by reducing padding, and the product size badge was repositioned to the
  top-right corner of the product image. A new sticky, scrollable CategoryBar component was implemented below the main navigation,
  fetching "popular" categories from a new backend API and displaying them as clickable badges that link to category-filtered search
  results. A TypeError in CategoryBar.tsx related to categories.map is not a function was resolved by correctly handling the
  paginated API response.

  Backend enhancements included the creation of a new API endpoint, /api/products/by-category/, enabling product filtering by
  category_slug and store_ids. The analyze management command was extended with a new category_product_counts report. This report
  lists categories ordered by product count, along with associated companies, and includes new --alphabetical and --strict arguments
  for sorting and filtering. A new is_popular boolean field was added to the Category model, which the analyze --report
  category_product_counts --strict command now updates to flag categories meeting specific criteria (at least 100 products and
  present in at least 3 companies). Finally, a new API endpoint, /api/categories/popular/, was created to expose these popular
  categories for frontend consumption.

  Currently, an issue persists where the CategoryBar displays all categories despite the analyze command with the --strict flag
  having been run. This suggests that the is_popular flag is not being correctly set in the database, which will be the next area of
  investigation.
