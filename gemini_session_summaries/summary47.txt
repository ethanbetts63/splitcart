This session involved significant refactoring of the popular categories feature, visual enhancements to the frontend, and improvements to search functionality.

**Popular Categories Refactoring:**
- A new `PopularCategory` model was introduced to represent unique popular categories, linked to store-specific `Category` objects via a ManyToManyField. This resolved the issue of duplicate categories appearing in the frontend.
- A new management command, `generate_pop_cats`, was created to populate this `PopularCategory` model based on product counts and company presence.
- The `analyze` management command's `--strict` option for category product counts was updated to use the `PopularCategory` model as its source of truth.
- API serializers and views for popular categories were updated to use the new `PopularCategory` model, and the redundant `is_popular` field was removed from the `Category` model.

**Category Bar Visuals and Functionality:**
- Pagination was disabled for the `/api/categories/popular/` endpoint to ensure all popular categories are returned in a single response.
- The `CategoryBar.tsx` component was updated to handle this non-paginated response.
- Custom CSS (`CategoryCarousel.css`) was created and applied to the `CategoryBar` to hide the horizontal scrollbar while maintaining scrolling functionality.
- The appearance of the category badges was changed from `outline` to `secondary` variant and their size was reduced.
- Vertical padding around the category carousel was adjusted to reduce excessive space.

**Search Bar Enhancements:**
- The main navigation search bar was made larger, its edges were rounded, and an integrated search button was added.
- The search button's size was reduced, and its color was changed to grey.

**Product Search Ordering:**
- The ordering of products displayed after clicking a category badge was updated. Products are now sorted first by the number of stores they appear in (descending), then alphabetically by product name.

**Home Page Hero Section:**
- A new hero section was added to the `HomePage`, featuring a two-column layout with descriptive text and an image (`confused_shopper.png`) using an `AspectRatio` component.
- The positions of the image and text columns in the hero section were swapped.
- Vertical padding for both the hero section and the subsequent product carousel section was reduced to create a more compact layout.
