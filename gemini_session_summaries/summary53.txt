I have now implemented the full email functionality.

-   **Frontend:** `FinalCartPage.tsx` now has a `handleEmail` function that:
    -   Checks if the user is authenticated using the `useAuth` hook.
    -   Redirects to `/login` if the user is not authenticated, showing a toast notification.
    -   Sends the `shopping_plan` and auth token to the `/api/cart/email-list/` endpoint.
    -   Shows a loading spinner on the button while the email is being sent.
    -   Displays success or error toasts based on the API response.
-   **Backend:** `EmailShoppingListView` now:
    -   Generates the PDF.
    -   Renders an HTML email template (`email/shopping_list_email.html`).
    -   Sends a multipart email with the HTML body and the PDF attachment.
-   **Templating:**
    -   A new email template has been created at `templates/email/shopping_list_email.html`.
    -   The `Toaster` component has been added to `main.tsx` to handle notifications.

I believe this completes the user's request. I will now wait for the next instruction.
