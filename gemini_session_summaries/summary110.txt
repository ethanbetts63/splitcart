This session involved a series of frontend and backend fixes, style adjustments, and an in-depth investigation and correction of the sitemap generation process.

Key activities included:

1.  **TypeScript and UI Fixes:** I addressed several frontend issues. A `possibly 'undefined'` TypeScript error in the `PillarPage.tsx` component was resolved by adding more robust null-checking. Several user-requested style changes were implemented to improve text contrast and appearance, including making footer text black, adjusting the color of a notification message, and modifying the discount badges on product tiles. Specifically for the badges, the Coles badge text was changed to white, and all discount badge text was made bold.

2.  **Accessibility Improvement:** We discussed an accessibility issue where multiple "Explore All Deals" links pointed to different category pages, creating ambiguity for screen reader users. This was resolved by adding a dynamic `aria-label` to each link in the `ProductCarousel.tsx` component, providing a unique and descriptive name for each link that includes the category title.

3.  **Backend Cache Configuration:** The server-side cache duration for the main product API endpoint was investigated. As requested, I located the configuration in the `ProductListView` and extended the cache time from one hour to six hours.

4.  **Sitemap Generation:** A significant portion of the session was dedicated to investigating and fixing the sitemap.
    *   Initial investigation suggested the sitemap was dynamic, but the user correctly pointed out that a static template was being rendered.
    *   After a mistaken suggestion to delete the template file resulted in an error, the root cause was correctly identified: the Django sitemap view was rendering a static `sitemap.xml` template that lacked the necessary logic to display the dynamic data.
    *   The issue was fully resolved by overwriting the `templates/sitemap.xml` file with the correct Django template code, which loops through the `urlset` variable to dynamically generate the list of all pages.
    *   We concluded with a discussion on sitemap priorities, affirming the current strategy of giving pillar pages a higher priority (0.9) than the homepage (0.5) is sound for SEO.

5.  **User Preferences:** During the session, I recorded the user's explicit preferences to never run `npm` or `git` commands.
