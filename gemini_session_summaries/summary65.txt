Objective:
The current objective is to prevent the `StoreMap` and `StoreList` components within the "edit location dialogue" from re-rendering unnecessarily when filter controls (like radius or company selection) are adjusted. The desired behavior is for these components to only update when the "Search" button is explicitly clicked.

Issue Faced:
Despite applying `React.memo` to both `StoreMap.tsx` and `StoreList.tsx`, these components are still re-rendering every time a filter is changed. This occurs because `React.memo` performs a shallow comparison of props. The `onStoreSelect` function, which is passed as a prop to both components, is re-created on every re-render of their parent component, `EditLocationPage.tsx`. Since this function object is new on each render, `React.memo` incorrectly perceives a prop change and triggers an unnecessary re-render of the child components.

Proposed Solutions:

1.  **Use the `useCallback` Hook (Recommended):**
    *   **What:** This solution involves wrapping the `handleLocalStoreSelect` function within `EditLocationPage.tsx` with the `useCallback` hook.
    *   **How it Works:** `useCallback` memoizes the function, ensuring that it remains the exact same function object across multiple renders of `EditLocationPage`, as long as its dependencies do not change.
    *   **Benefit:** This will ensure that `handleLocalStoreSelect` remains the same function object across re-renders of `EditLocationPage` (as long as its dependencies don't change). Consequently, `React.memo` on `StoreMap` and `StoreList` will correctly identify that the `onStoreSelect` prop has not changed, thereby preventing unnecessary re-renders of these components when only filter states are being adjusted. This is the standard and most direct React optimization for this scenario.

2.  **Architectural State Refactoring (More Complex):**
    *   **What:** This approach would involve a more significant restructuring of the component's state management.
    *   **How it Works:** It would introduce "draft" state variables for the filters that update immediately upon user interaction. The "active" state, which `StoreMap` and `StoreList` depend on, would only be updated when the "Search" button is clicked. This would effectively decouple the filter UI from the map/list rendering logic.
    *   **Benefit:** It would prevent re-renders by ensuring the map and list components are only connected to state that changes upon an explicit search action.
    *   **Downside:** This is a more extensive and complex refactoring, potentially introducing more boilerplate and architectural overhead than necessary for the current problem.

Decision:
The user has chosen to proceed with **Option 1 (using the `useCallback` hook)** due to its directness, efficiency, and alignment with standard React optimization patterns.
