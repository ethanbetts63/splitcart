The session was focused on debugging a series of cascading `SyntaxError` and TypeScript type-checking errors in the `frontend` React application. The root cause was a combination of issues related to module resolution in Vite and the `verbatimModuleSyntax` TypeScript setting.

The initial error was in `ShoppingListContext.tsx`, where `CartItem` could not be imported. The debugging process involved:
1.  Refactoring the type definitions in `src/types/` by moving `Product`, `CompanyPriceInfo`, and `CartItem` into their own dedicated files (`Product.ts` and `CartItem.ts`).
2.  Updating all affected components to import the types from their new, specific file paths.
3.  Modifying all type imports to be type-only imports (e.g., `import type { ... } from '...'`) to comply with the `verbatimModuleSyntax` TypeScript compiler option.
4.  Changing the export syntax in the type definition files to `export { type ... }` to ensure compatibility with the build process.

This process was repeated for several component files as new errors emerged, including:
- `ShoppingListContext.tsx`
- `StoreMap.tsx`
- `AddToCartButton.tsx`
- `PriceDisplay.tsx`
- `TrolleyItemTile.tsx`
- `ProductGrid.tsx`

By the end of the session, all reported errors had been resolved by systematically applying this new type import/export strategy across the codebase.
