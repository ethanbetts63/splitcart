## Session Summary 84

This session focused on implementing the SuperCategory feature, from backend to frontend, and then correcting a mistake I made during the process.

**1. SuperCategory Model and Management Command:**
- A `create_super_categories.py` management command was created to populate the `SuperCategory` model.
- Initially, the command was designed to parse the `cat_groupings.txt` file, but was later modified to use a hardcoded dictionary for robustness.
- The command was made idempotent by deleting all existing `SuperCategory` instances before creation.
- The command was also updated to associate `Bargain` products with their respective `SuperCategory`.

**2. Frontend Carousel Implementation:**
- The `bargain_list_view.py` was modified to accept a `super_category` query parameter, allowing the frontend to fetch bargains for a specific super category.
- The `HomePage.tsx` was updated to replace the existing hardcoded carousels with four new carousels, one for each SuperCategory: "Everyday Essentials", "Pantry Power-Ups", "Little Luxuries", and "Drinks & Delights".

**3. Correction of a Mistake:**
- I mistakenly removed the personal letter from the `HomePage.tsx` file while updating the carousels.
- I restored the personal letter to its original location after the user pointed out the mistake.
