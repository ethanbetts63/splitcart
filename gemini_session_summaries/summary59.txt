1.  **Backend `api/views/store_list_views.py` Modifications:**
    *   Secured `SelectedStoreList` endpoints to be `IsAuthenticated` only.
    *   Updated `perform_create` to generate a unique name for new store lists, fixing the `IntegrityError`.
2.  **Backend `api/views/anonymous_user_view.py` Creation:**
    *   Created a new view to handle anonymous user creation and their default store list.
    *   Added a URL pattern for this new view in `api/urls.py`.
3.  **Frontend `EditLocationPage.tsx` Modifications:**
    *   Conditionally rendered the store list management UI based on `isAuthenticated`.
    *   Updated `useEffect` to call `fetchActiveStoreList` for both authenticated and anonymous users.
    *   Updated `useAuth()` destructuring to include `anonymousId`.
4.  **Frontend `StoreContext.tsx` Modifications:**
    *   Renamed `fetchUserStoreLists` to `fetchActiveStoreList` and updated its logic to handle both authenticated and anonymous users.
    *   Updated the `StoreContext.Provider` value to expose `fetchActiveStoreList`.
5.  **Plan Updates:**
    *   Updated `cart_management_plan.txt` to reflect all the backend and frontend changes made during this session, and included a `TODO` for the remaining work.
