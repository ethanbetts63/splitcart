This session focused on three main areas: implementing a robust default pricing mechanism for stores without data, creating a new "Bargains" page, and fixing a series of bugs across the application.

**1. Default Anchor Pricing Fallback Logic**

The most significant architectural change was the introduction of a robust fallback system for pricing. When a user selects a store that has not yet been scraped, the system now intelligently falls back to a default, nationally-priced anchor store for that company (excluding IGA).

*   A new centralized utility, `get_pricing_stores.py`, was created to contain this logic.
*   This utility was integrated into all key user-facing data pathways to ensure consistent pricing, including:
    *   The main Product List, Product Detail, and Bargain Carousel APIs.
    *   The substitution generation logic that is triggered when a user adds an item to their cart.
    *   The final cart optimization view, ensuring savings calculations are accurate even with un-scraped stores.

**2. New "Bargains" Page**

A new, dedicated "Bargains" page was created to highlight the best deals.

*   The page, accessible from the main navigation bar, features a hero section and four company-specific carousels (Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, IGA).
*   Each carousel is powered by an updated backend API that now filters for bargains where that specific company offers the cheapest price.
*   During implementation, several frontend issues were resolved, including fixing incorrect component imports and a bug causing props to leak between carousel instances. The hero section's text was also updated with more engaging, user-provided copy.

**3. Maintenance and Bug Fixes**

A variety of bugs and errors were resolved throughout the application:

*   **Scrapers:** Fixed a `403 Forbidden` error in the Woolworths scraper by updating its request headers. Corrected an `AttributeError` in the Coles barcode scraper's CAPTCHA-handling logic.
*   **Management Commands:** A new `store_stats` command was created to report on store data freshness. Bugs were fixed in the `analyze` command (`ModuleNotFoundError`), the `gs1_uploader` command (`FileExistsError`), and the new `store_stats` command (`SyntaxError`).
*   **API Views:** Resolved a `ValueError` in the `ProductListView` caused by an improperly applied decorator.
