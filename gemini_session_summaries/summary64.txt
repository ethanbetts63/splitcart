Objective:
The primary goal of this session was to diagnose and resolve a performance issue where company logo images were being repeatedly requested from the network during user interactions in the "edit location dialogue."

Investigation & Solution:
Our initial investigation determined that the issue was not caused by traditional API calls, but by React components re-rendering and triggering the browser to re-fetch static image assets from the development server.

To solve this and create a scalable, site-wide solution, we implemented a new, centralized caching system for images using React Query. The architecture consists of three key parts:
1.  A central library (`frontend/src/lib/companies.ts`) that acts as a single source of truth for company names and their corresponding logo paths.
2.  A generic, reusable hook (`useImageAsset`) that can fetch any image, convert it to a local `blob:` URL, and cache that URL indefinitely using React Query.
3.  A specific convenience hook (`useCompanyLogo`) that allows any component to easily retrieve a cached logo URL by simply providing the company's name.

Execution & Refactoring:
We systematically refactored every component that was using the old, direct-import method for logos, updating them to use the new `useCompanyLogo` hook. This ensures all logos are now served efficiently from the cache.

The following components were updated:
- `CompanyFilter.tsx`
- `StoreList.tsx`
- `StoreMap.tsx`
- `PriceDisplay.tsx`

Outcome:
The repeated, expensive network requests for company logos have been successfully eliminated across the application. They have been replaced by efficient, instantaneous memory lookups via cached `blob:` URLs. The new system is robust, centralized, and ensures optimal performance for all image assets it manages. We also addressed a minor compilation error caused by a typo during the refactoring process.
