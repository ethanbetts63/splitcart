During this session, we accomplished a wide range of tasks, including feature implementation, bug fixing, and UI/UX improvements.

First, we focused on visual updates for the frontend. We replaced the main hero image on the Bargains page with a new 'bargains.webp' image. To support this, we created a new Django management command, 'resize_images.py', to automatically generate responsive sizes for frontend images. This utility was then used to process both the new hero image and a new image for the FAQ section, 'snack_lineup.webp'.

Next, we implemented a significant new feature: the "Explore all deals" button on the bargain carousels. Our initial approach of using the existing search page proved flawed. Following a discussion, we pivoted to a more robust, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) solution. We created a centralized 'calculate_bargains' utility function in the backend to handle all bargain calculations. We then refactored the existing 'BargainCarouselView' to use this utility and enhanced the main 'ProductListView' to accept a 'bargain_company' query parameter. This allows the frontend to request a paginated list of all bargains for a specific company (e.g., Coles) via a consistent '/search?bargain_company=...' URL structure. The corresponding frontend components ('ProductCarousel', 'SearchResultsPage', 'GridSourcer') were updated to support this new API.

Throughout this process, we addressed several bugs. We fixed a 'NameError' in the 'BargainCarouselView' by adding missing imports. We also resolved an issue where the homepage bargain carousel disappeared after our refactoring by correcting the database query used to find bargain candidates.

Finally, we made several UI/UX improvements. We addressed an issue where the hero image appeared "too zoomed in" by changing its CSS 'object-fit' property. Based on user feedback, we also conditionally hid the sorting dropdown on the search results page when viewing bargains, as it was not applicable. We also improved responsiveness by shortening the text on "Explore" buttons on smaller screen sizes. To conclude the session, we added new FAQ content for the "Snacks & Sweets" page to the 'FAQ.jsonl' data file and updated the database.
