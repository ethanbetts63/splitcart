In this session, we conducted a major UI/UX overhaul of the `FinalCartPage` to improve clarity and usability when displaying optimized shopping cart results.

First, we replaced the original, cluttered layout of stacked collapsible tiles with a clean, tabbed interface. This involved creating a reusable `Tabs` component where each tab represents a different store combination (e.g., "2 Stores") and prominently displays the total cost and savings percentage. A corresponding `TabPanel` component was created to show the detailed shopping list for the selected tab.

Next, we addressed the presentation of results for carts with and without product substitutes. The initial design was replaced with a toggle mechanism. After some iteration, this evolved from a centered toggle switch into a red "Disable Subs" / "Enable Subs" button positioned in the top-right corner of the results container for better clarity and user control.

We then refactored the layout of the store lists within each tab. To create a more organized and visually appealing presentation, we moved from a simple vertical list to a responsive, two-column grid layout. This ensures that on larger screens, store lists are tiled side-by-side.

To improve code modularity and styling, the logic for displaying a single store's shopping list was extracted into its own `StoreListComponent`. This component was styled with a distinct background, border, and shadow to make each store's list stand out as a card.

Finally, we implemented a header within the `StoreListComponent` to display the company logo, the full store name, and the total spend at that store. This presented a significant challenge, as the necessary company information was not available on the frontend. After a discussion, we opted to modify the backend cart optimization API to include the `company_name` in its response. The frontend was then updated to use this new data, allowing the `StoreListComponent` to map the company name to the correct, locally-stored logo file, mirroring the design pattern used elsewhere in the application.
