This session continued the refactoring efforts, focusing on consolidating and correcting URL configurations and resolving import errors introduced by the previous file movements.

Key actions and resolutions:

1.  **URL Prefix Removal**: The `/api/` prefix for the new API endpoints was removed from `splitcart/urls.py` as requested by the user. All new API routes are now directly included in the main `urlpatterns`.
2.  **Sitemap Migration**: `StaticViewSitemap` and `PillarPageSitemap` were moved from `api/sitemaps.py` to `data_management/sitemaps.py`, and the import in `splitcart/urls.py` was updated accordingly. This further reduces reliance on the old `api` app.
3.  **Import Error Resolution**: A series of `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError` issues were systematically addressed across various apps:
    *   **`splitcart/urls.py`**: Imports for `FaqListView`, `PillarPageView`, `PrimaryCategoryListView`, and `ReactAppView` were updated to correctly point to their new location in `data_management.views`.
    *   **`products/urls.py`**: Corrected imports for `ProductListView`, `ProductDetailView`, `ProductSubstituteListView` (and its usage in URL patterns), `BargainView` (aliased from `BargainCarouselView`), and `BargainStatsView` (corrected name and module path). `ProductSearchView` was removed as it was not found in the codebase.
    *   **`companies/urls.py`**: Imports for `CompanyListView`, `NearbyStoreListView`, and `PostcodeSearchView` (renamed from `PostcodeGeocodeView`) were corrected, and references to views that no longer exist were removed.
    *   **`users/urls.py`**: Imports for various cart-related views (e.g., `CartOptimizationView`, `ActiveCartDetailView`) were updated to correctly point to their new individual files within `users.views`.
    *   **`data_management/urls.py`**: Imports for file upload and import views were updated to point to their new individual files within `data_management.views`.
4.  **Package Restructuring**:
    *   An empty `__init__.py` file was created in `users/serializers/` to correctly mark it as a Python package.
    *   The `CustomLoginSerializer` and `CustomRegisterSerializer`, initially found in `users/serializers.py` (a module conflicting with the `users/serializers/` package), were moved into dedicated files (`custom_login_serializer.py` and `custom_register_serializer.py`) within the `users/serializers/` directory.
    *   `users/serializers/__init__.py` was updated to import these serializers, making them accessible via the `users.serializers` package.
5.  **Model Import**: The `Cart` model was correctly imported in `users/views/cart_retrieve_update_destroy_view.py` to resolve a `NameError`.

After these extensive corrections, running `python manage.py check` resulted in "System check identified no issues (0 silenced)." The project now appears to be in a consistent state regarding URL configurations and module imports, adhering to the refactoring goals.
