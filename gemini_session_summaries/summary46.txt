This session addressed an issue where the frontend displayed duplicate 'popular' categories. The root cause was that the system flagged every store-specific category (e.g., 'Bakery' at Coles, 'Bakery' at Woolworths) as popular, leading to multiple entries for the same conceptual category.

The solution was to introduce a new `PopularCategory` model to represent a single, unique popular category (e.g., 'Bakery'). This model is linked to the various store-specific category entries via a many-to-many relationship.

To implement this, I created a new management command, `generate_pop_cats`, which is now responsible for identifying and populating the `PopularCategory` model based on predefined criteria (product count and company presence). The existing `analyze` command was then refactored to use the `PopularCategory` model as the source of truth for its reporting, separating the logic for generation and analysis.

Finally, the API endpoint that serves the frontend's category bar was updated to query the new `PopularCategory` model, ensuring a clean, de-duplicated list is displayed. The now-obsolete `is_popular` field on the original `Category` model was removed, and the database schema was updated accordingly.
