This session focused on investigating and fixing several data normalization and parsing issues within the scraping pipeline.

**1. Investigation of 'each' Unit Normalization:**
*   **Problem:** The user noted that products sold by 'each' (e.g., "approx. 5 ea per package") were not being correctly normalized into a standardized unit price (e.g., price per kg).
*   **Findings:** The investigation revealed that the `BaseDataCleaner` class contained logic to standardize prices for 'g', 'kg', 'ml', and 'l', but had no corresponding rule for the 'each' unit. This meant the normalization was being skipped for these products, not handled incorrectly.

**2. Investigation of Slash Separators in Prices:**
*   **Problem:** The user correctly suspected that the normalizer could not handle price strings where a slash separated the value and unit (e.g., "$1.75/l").
*   **Findings:** Analysis of `price_normalizer.py` and `product_normalizer.py` confirmed that the regular expressions were only looking for whitespace between a number and its unit, causing the parsing to fail for strings with a slash.

**3. Implementation of Fixes:**
*   To resolve the slash-separator issue, the regular expressions in both `price_normalizer.py` and `product_normalizer.py` were updated to optionally accept a '/' as a valid separator.

**4. Creation of a Recalculation Command:**
*   **Request:** The user asked for a new management command (`recalculate_jsonl_files`) to apply the updated normalization logic to all existing `.jsonl` files in the `product_jsonl` directory without modifying the database.
*   **Process:**
    *   An initial version of the command was created but had logical flaws in how it read the `.jsonl` files and parsed metadata.
    *   After receiving feedback and clarification from the user, the command was completely rewritten.
    *   The final, corrected version now surgically recalculates only the necessary fields (`unit_price`, `unit_of_measure`, `price_hash`) for each product by using the data contained within the file itself, and writes the corrected data back in the proper JSONL format.

**5. Clarification:**
*   The session concluded with a clarification on why the `company` name is a necessary parameter for price calculations: it is used to handle the specific case of Aldi's prices, which are provided in cents from the source data, unlike other stores.
