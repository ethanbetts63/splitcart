This session focused on optimizing frontend performance by resizing images, analyzing database scripts, and fixing a critical sitemap configuration issue.

Key activities included:

1.  **Image URL Optimization:** To address performance issues from unnecessarily large images, I investigated how product image URLs were generated for each partner company. I then implemented a centralized image resizing strategy in the backend `ProductSerializer`. This new logic modifies the image URLs for Aldi, IGA, and Woolworths to request smaller, more appropriately sized images from their respective CDNs, reducing download sizes for users. I also helped debug a caching issue that was preventing the changes from appearing immediately.

2.  **Database Script Analysis:** At your request, I analyzed two data generation scripts. I determined that `PriceComparisonsGenerator` both updates the database with new price comparison statistics and prints a summary report to the console. In contrast, `PrimaryCategoriesGenerator` is a database maintenance script that performs major updates by recreating primary category relationships and does not produce a summary report.

3.  **Sitemap Domain Correction:** We diagnosed a "URL not allowed" error reported by search engine tools for the sitemap. The root cause was identified as the default Django "Sites" framework domain being set to `example.com`. After explaining why this required a database change rather than a settings file modification, I created and executed a temporary management command to update the site domain to `www.splitcart.com.au`, resolving the error.
