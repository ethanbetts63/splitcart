This session focused on refining the SplitCart frontend. I fixed a store_address error on the final cart page and improved the
  substitution page's logic to only display items with substitutes, removing redundant API calls. Navigation on the substitution page
  was enhanced, allowing users to return home from the first item or skip directly to the final cart. The main navigation bar received
  a "Next" button, conditional rendering, and size adjustments for better visibility, including badges for cart items and selected
  stores. Finally, the final cart page's loading screen was upgraded with dynamic, random messages and a 7-second refresh timer.

  The SplitCart frontend is a React/TypeScript application using react-router-dom, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. Key files include:

   * Main Layout: frontend1/src/App.tsx (navigation, routing, global state)
   * Home Page: frontend1/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (product carousels)
   * Substitution Page: frontend1/src/pages/SubstitutionPage.tsx (substitute selection, navigation)
   * Final Cart Page: frontend1/src/pages/FinalCartPage.tsx (optimized plan, dynamic loading)
   * Trolley Dialog: frontend1/src/pages/dialog-pages/TrolleyPage.tsx (cart display, substitution initiation)
   * Product Tile: frontend1/src/components/ProductTile.tsx (product display, text centering)
   * Price Display: frontend1/src/components/PriceDisplay.tsx (price display, text centering)
   * Next Button Component: frontend1/src/components/NextButton.tsx (reusable navigation logic)
   * Contexts: frontend1/src/context/ShoppingListContext.tsx, frontend1/src/context/StoreContext.tsx,
     frontend1/src/context/SubstitutionContext.tsx
   * Utilities: frontend1/src/lib/utils.ts (cn helper)
   * Global Styles: frontend1/src/App.css (header width adjustment)
