Session Summary (39)

## Objective:
Integrate `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS into the frontend, and then debug a subsequent issue with the main products page not displaying products.

## Key Activities:

1.  **`shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS Integration:**
    -   The user requested to use `shadcn/ui` components, which required setting up Tailwind CSS first.
    -   I installed Tailwind CSS and its dependencies (`postcss`, `autoprefixer`).
    -   I encountered and resolved several issues during the setup process:
        -   The `npx tailwindcss init -p` command failed, so I manually created the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.
        -   I configured `tailwind.config.js` with the correct content paths.
        -   I added the Tailwind directives to the main CSS file (`frontend/src/css/index.css`).
        -   The `shadcn-ui init` command failed due to a missing import alias in a JavaScript project. I resolved this by creating a `jsconfig.json` file and updating `vite.config.js` with the correct alias configuration.
        -   I encountered a PostCSS error related to Tailwind CSS v4. I resolved this by installing `@tailwindcss/vite`, updating `vite.config.js` to use the new plugin, and removing the `postcss.config.js` file.
        -   I resolved a `Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css'` error by removing the incorrect import from the CSS file.

2.  **Component Application:**
    -   The user requested to apply the `shadcn/ui` `Button` and `Input` components to the postcode search feature.
    -   I identified the `OffCanvasMenu.jsx` component as the correct location for this feature.
    -   I added the `Input` component using the `shadcn` CLI.
    -   I modified `OffCanvasMenu.jsx` to use the `Button` and `Input` components from `shadcn/ui`.

3.  **Debugging the Products Page:**
    -   The user reported that the main products page was no longer displaying products after the recent frontend changes.
    -   I investigated the issue by examining the relevant components: `ProductListPage.jsx`, `GridSourcer.jsx`, and `ProductGrid.jsx`.
    -   I suspected a CSS conflict and refactored `ProductGrid.jsx` to use Tailwind CSS classes instead of inline styles.
    -   The user reported that this did not fix the issue and that they suspect no API calls are being made.

## Next Steps:

-   Continue debugging the products page issue, focusing on why the API calls might not be happening.
-   I will investigate the `GridSourcer.jsx` component and add logging to trace the execution flow.
-   The user has confirmed that the search functionality works, which means `GridSourcer` is working correctly. The issue is with the horizontal scrollers on the main page.
-   The user is seeing skeleton cards in the horizontal scrollers, which suggests that the data is not being loaded.
-   My next step is to investigate `ScrollerManager.jsx` and `SearchSourcer.jsx` to understand why the API calls for the scrollers are not being made.
-   I found that the `SearchSourcer` component had a dependency on `isLocationLoaded`, which was preventing the product data from being fetched. I removed this dependency to fix the issue.
-   The user then requested to replace the range slider in the map section with the `shadcn/ui` slider component.
-   I added the `Slider` component and updated the `StoreMap.jsx` file to use it.
-   The user also requested to make the slider dot bigger. I inspected the `slider.jsx` component and updated the `StoreMap.css` file to increase the size of the slider thumb.
