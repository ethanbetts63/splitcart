## Session Summary

This session focused on refactoring the bargain generation process to align with the existing `generate -> upload -> update` data pipeline pattern, similar to how substitutions and category links are handled. This change decouples the data generation from the database update, improving the system's robustness and scalability.

### Key Changes and Implementations:

1.  **Bargain Generation Refactoring:**
    *   **`BargainsGenerator` Modification:** The `BargainsGenerator` was modified to fetch product and price data from the API instead of directly from the database. It now generates a `bargains.json` file and saves it to the `data_management/data/outboxes/bargains_outbox` directory.
    *   **New API Endpoint:** A new `/api/export/prices/` endpoint was created to export all price data, which is used by the `BargainsGenerator`.
    *   **`BargainsUploader`:** A new `BargainsUploader` class was created to upload the generated `bargains.json` file to the server.
    *   **`upload` Command Update:** The `upload` management command was updated with a `--bargains` flag to trigger the `BargainsUploader`.
    *   **`BargainsFileUploadView`:** A new `BargainsFileUploadView` was created to handle the uploaded bargains file, decompress it, and save it to the `data_management/data/inboxes/bargains_inbox` directory.
    *   **`BargainUpdateOrchestrator`:** A new `BargainUpdateOrchestrator` was created to process the `bargains.json` file from the inbox and update the `Bargain` model in the database.
    *   **`update` Command Update:** The `update` management command was updated with a `--bargains` flag to trigger the `BargainUpdateOrchestrator`.

2.  **Investigation and Diagnosis:**
    *   **Substitution Generation Process:** I investigated the full substitution generation process to understand the existing data pipeline pattern.
    *   **`store_product_id` to `sku` Renaming:** I confirmed that the renaming of the `store_product_id` field to `sku` has been consistently applied across the project.
    *   **Search Tool:** I diagnosed an issue with the `search_file_content` tool, which was not returning any results.

### Commands to Run:

**For Bargains:**
1.  `python manage.py generate --bargains --dev`
2.  `python manage.py upload --bargains --dev`
3.  `python manage.py update --bargains`
