### Session Summary: Fix 404 on Cart Item Deletion

**Objective:** Resolve the 404 "Page Not Found" error occurring when attempting to delete a cart item by changing its quantity to 0.

**Problem:** The error was identified to be a mismatch between the URL pattern defined in `api/urls.py` and the actual primary key type of the `CartItem` model.

**Investigation:**
1.  Examined `api/urls.py` and found the URL pattern for `ActiveCartItemUpdateDestroyView` was `path('carts/active/items/<int:pk>/', ...)`, expecting an integer primary key.
2.  Investigated the `CartItem` model definition in `users/models/cart_item.py` and confirmed that the `id` field is a `UUIDField` (`id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)`).

**Solution:**
1.  Modified `api/urls.py` to change the URL pattern for `ActiveCartItemUpdateDestroyView` from `<int:pk>` to `<uuid:pk>`.

**Outcome:** The URL pattern now correctly matches the `UUIDField` primary key of the `CartItem` model, resolving the 404 error and allowing cart items to be deleted successfully.
