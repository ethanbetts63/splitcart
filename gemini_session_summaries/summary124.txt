This session focused on refactoring the Django project by duplicating the functionality of the monolithic `api` app into other domain-specific apps, as detailed in the `api_migration_plan.md` document.

The following steps were taken:
1.  **File Duplication**: All relevant serializers, views, and utils from the `api` app were copied to the `products`, `companies`, `users`, `data_management`, and `splitcart` apps.
2.  **Import Fixing**: All relative and absolute import paths in the newly created files were updated to reflect their new locations and the new project structure.
3.  **URL Configuration**:
    *   New `urls.py` files were created in each of the refactored apps (`products`, `companies`, `users`, `data_management`).
    *   The main `splitcart/urls.py` was updated to include the new URL files under the `/api/` prefix, replacing the old `api.urls`.
    *   The `splitcart` app's own API views were also integrated into the main `urls.py`.
    *   The `ReactAppView` was moved from the `api` app to the `splitcart` app and the main `urls.py` was updated to reflect this change.

The result is a new API structure that is more modular and easier to maintain, with the new API endpoints available under the `/api/` prefix. The old `api` app is no longer used for serving the API, but its files remain in the project for reference.
