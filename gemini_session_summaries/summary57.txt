1.  **Frontend Simplification (Removed Save/Set Default Buttons):** The user requested to simplify the frontend by removing the "Save Current" and "Set Default" buttons from `EditLocationPage.tsx`. I implemented this change, leaving only the "Delete List" button.
2.  **Backend Default Store List Logic (Discussion):** The user suggested that the default store list should be automatically set on the backend to the last one used.
    *   I updated the `SelectedStoreList` model in `users/models/selected_store_list.py` to remove the `is_default` field and add a `last_used_at` (DateTimeField).
    *   I updated the `cart_management_plan.txt` to reflect this model change.
3.  **Frontend `EditLocationPage.tsx` Implementation (Store List Management):**
    *   I added `useEffect` to the React import statement in `EditLocationPage.tsx` to resolve a `ReferenceError`.
    *   I updated the destructuring of `useStoreSelection` to include new state variables and functions for store list management.
    *   I added the `useAuth` hook call and a `useEffect` to fetch `userStoreLists` on mount if authenticated.
    *   I populated the `Select` component with `userStoreLists` and implemented the `onValueChange` handler for selection changes.
    *   I implemented handlers for the "Save", "Set Default", and "Delete" buttons (though "Save" and "Set Default" were later removed).
4.  **Frontend `StoreContext.tsx` Modifications:**
    *   I added `SelectedStoreListType` definition and updated the `StoreContextType` interface to include new state and functions for store list management.
    *   I added new state variables for `SelectedStoreList` management and the `useAuth` hook call within `StoreProvider`.
    *   I added new functions for `SelectedStoreList` operations (`getAuthHeaders`, `fetchUserStoreLists`, `loadStoreList`, `saveStoreList`, `createNewStoreList`, `deleteStoreList`) and updated the `StoreContext.Provider` value to expose these.
5.  **Missing `select.tsx` Component:** I identified that the `select.tsx` component was missing from `frontend/src/components/ui/`, causing a build error. I informed the user about this and suggested installing it using the Shadcn/ui CLI.
