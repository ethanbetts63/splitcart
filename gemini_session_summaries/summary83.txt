## Session Summary 83

This session focused on enhancing reporting capabilities and laying the groundwork for a new "SuperCategory" feature.

**1. Category Product Count Report Enhancement:**
- Added a `--condensed` argument to the `analyze` management command. This argument allows users to generate a more focused report for `category_product_counts`.
- When `--condensed` is used, the report output file is named with a `-condensed` suffix.
- The `generate_category_product_count_report` function was updated to:
    - Filter categories to include only those with 100 or more products.
    - Sort categories first by the number of associated companies (descending), then by the product count (descending).
    - Include the category IDs in the report output for better identification.
- The CSV-style list of category names, which was previously missing, was restored to the end of the report for both condensed and regular outputs.

**2. SuperCategory Model Implementation:**
- Introduced a new `SuperCategory` model in `products/models/super_category.py`. This model is designed to group existing `Category` instances into broader classifications (e.g., "Everyday Essentials").
- The `Bargain` model in `products/models/bargain.py` was modified to include a `ManyToManyField` to the new `SuperCategory` model. This allows individual bargains to be associated with one or more super categories, which will be used for frontend carousel population.
- Corrected import statements in `products/models/__init__.py` to properly include `SuperCategory`, `ProductBrand`, and `ProductSubstitution` models, resolving an initial `ImportError`.
- Successfully created and applied Django database migrations for the `products` app to reflect these model changes.

**3. Preparation for SuperCategory Population Command:**
- Began the process of creating a management command (`create_super_categories.py`) to populate the `SuperCategory` model from the `cat_groupings.txt` file. This command was drafted but its execution was cancelled by the user.
