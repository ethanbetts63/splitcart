│     4 - Key Accomplishments:                                                                                                      │
│     3 + This session focused on addressing several issues in the `splitcart` frontend.                                            │
│     4                                                                                                                             │
│     6 - 1.  **Store Map Marker Interaction Enhancement:**                                                                         │
│     7 -     *   **Issue:** Store markers on the map opened an intrusive popup on click, and lacked hover feedback.                │
│     8 -     *   **Resolution:** We refactored `frontend/src/components/StoreMap.tsx`. The on-click popup was removed. Instead,    │
│       hovering over a marker now displays the store's name in a badge at the top of the map area, providing clear identification  │
│       without interrupting the selection process.                                                                                 │
│     5 + 1.  **Resolved `TypeError` in `CompanyFilter.tsx`**: The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')" │
│       was fixed by providing a default empty array for the `selectedCompanies` prop in the `CompanyFilter` component. This        │
│       ensured `selectedCompanies` is always an array, preventing runtime errors.                                                  │
│     6                                                                                                                             │
│    10 - 2.  **Store List Tile Padding Adjustment:**                                                                               │
│    11 -     *   **Issue:** Store list tiles were visually too thick due to excessive internal padding.                            │
│    12 -     *   **Resolution:** We identified that the base `Card` component was applying a large default vertical padding. We    │
│       overrode this by adding a `py-1` class to the `<Card>` component in `frontend/src/components/StoreList.tsx`, making the     │
│       tiles noticeably thinner.                                                                                                   │
│     7 + 2.  **Removed Company Names from `CompanyFilter.tsx`**: Per user request, the visible company names were removed from the │
│       `CompanyFilter` component, leaving only the logos.                                                                          │
│     8                                                                                                                             │
│    14 - 3.  **Multiple Postcode Input Implementation:**                                                                           │
│    15 -     *   **Requirement:** Implement an intuitive way for users to input up to 5 postcodes with automatic badging and easy  │
│       editing.                                                                                                                    │
│    16 -     *   **Resolution:**                                                                                                   │
│    17 -         *   We created a new `MultiplePostcodeInput` component in `frontend/src/components/MultiplePostcodeInput.tsx`.    │
│       This component features automatic conversion of 4-digit inputs into deletable badges.                                       │
│    18 -         *   A key UX feature was implemented: pressing `Backspace` on an empty input "de-badgifies" the last postcode,    │
│       placing its first three digits back into the input field for quick editing.                                                 │
│    19 -         *   This new component was integrated into `frontend/src/pages/dialog-pages/EditLocationPage.tsx`, replacing the  │
│       old single postcode input and updating validation logic to handle multiple postcodes.                                       │
│     9 + 3.  **Adjusted Logo Size in `CompanyFilter.tsx`**: The logos were made smaller and thinner by modifying the `className`   │
│       for the `img` tag, `Skeleton`, and fallback `div` within the `CompanyLogo` component. The dimensions were adjusted from     │
│       `h-6 w-auto` to `h-4 w-8`, and then further to `h-4 w-6` to meet user specifications.                                       │
│    10                                                                                                                             │
│    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ │
│    21 - 4.  **"Done" Button Implementation:**                                                                                     │
│    22 -     *   **Requirement:** Add a green "Done" button below the "Search" button to close the dialog.                         │
│    23 -     *   **Resolution:** We ensured the `onOpenChange` prop was correctly passed to                                        │
│       `frontend/src/pages/dialog-pages/EditLocationPage.tsx` (by modifying `frontend/src/components/settings-dialog.tsx`). Then,  │
│       we added the "Done" button to `EditLocationPage.tsx` with the specified styling and functionality to close the dialog.      │
│    11 + 4.  **Resolved "Cannot find name 'Input'" Warning in `EditLocationPage.tsx`**: The `Input` component was being used       │
│       without a proper import. This was resolved by adding `import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";` to the file.          │
│    12                                                                                                                             │

│    25 - 5.  **Postcode and Filter Default State Fixes:**                                                                          │
│    26 -     *   **Issue 1:** The postcode input field defaulted to "5000" on a fresh load.                                        │
│    27 -     *   **Issue 2:** Company filter buttons started in the red "off" state, rather than the white "on" state.             │
│    28 -     *   **Resolution:** We modified `frontend/src/context/StoreSearchContext.tsx` to:                                     │
│    29 -         *   Change the default `postcode` state to an empty string `''`.                                                  │
│    30 -         *   Initialize the `selectedCompanies` state with all available company names by default, ensuring all filters    │
│       start in the "on" (white) state.                                                                                            │
│    13 + 5.  **Resolved "'handleKeyDown' is declared but its value is never read" Warning in `EditLocationPage.tsx`**: The         │
│       `handleKeyDown` function was identified as unused. After user consultation, it was decided to remove the function and its   │
│       associated `onKeyDown` prop from the `MultiplePostcodeInput` component, thereby cleaning up the code and resolving the      │
│       warning.                                                                                                                    │

│    32 - 6.  **Max Radius Adjustment:**                                                                                            │
│    33 -     *   **Requirement:** Change the maximum radius for the search from 50km to 30km.                                      │
│    34 -     *   **Resolution:** We modified `frontend/src/components/RadiusSlider.tsx` to change the default `max` prop value     │
│       from 50 to 30.                                                                                                              │
│    15 + 6.  **Addressed "Property 'selectedCompanies' is missing" Error in `CompanyFilter.tsx`**: A TypeScript error occurred     │
│       because the `selectedCompanies` prop was required by the `CompanyFilterProps` interface but was not always provided. This   │
│       was resolved by making the `selectedCompanies` prop optional in the `CompanyFilterProps` interface (`selectedCompanies?:    │
│       string[]`).                                                                                                                 │

│    17 + 7.  **Attempted to Fix Unclickable Company Filter Buttons**: The user reported that the company filter buttons were not   │
│       clickable. A solution was proposed to make the entire `div` containing the checkbox and logo clickable, but the operation   │
│       was cancelled by the user to request this session summary. This task remains pending.
