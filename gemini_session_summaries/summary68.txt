Objective:
This session focused on further enhancing the "Edit Location" dialogue's user interface and experience, including map interactions, input methods, and addressing default state behaviors.

Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Store Map Marker Interaction Enhancement:**
    *   **Issue:** Store markers on the map opened an intrusive popup on click, and lacked hover feedback.
    *   **Resolution:** We refactored `frontend/src/components/StoreMap.tsx`. The on-click popup was removed. Instead, hovering over a marker now displays the store's name in a badge at the top of the map area, providing clear identification without interrupting the selection process.

2.  **Store List Tile Padding Adjustment:**
    *   **Issue:** Store list tiles were visually too thick due to excessive internal padding.
    *   **Resolution:** We identified that the base `Card` component was applying a large default vertical padding. We overrode this by adding a `py-1` class to the `<Card>` component in `frontend/src/components/StoreList.tsx`, making the tiles noticeably thinner.

3.  **Multiple Postcode Input Implementation:**
    *   **Requirement:** Implement an intuitive way for users to input up to 5 postcodes with automatic badging and easy editing.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   We created a new `MultiplePostcodeInput` component in `frontend/src/components/MultiplePostcodeInput.tsx`. This component features automatic conversion of 4-digit inputs into deletable badges.
        *   A key UX feature was implemented: pressing `Backspace` on an empty input "de-badgifies" the last postcode, placing its first three digits back into the input field for quick editing.
        *   This new component was integrated into `frontend/src/pages/dialog-pages/EditLocationPage.tsx`, replacing the old single postcode input and updating validation logic to handle multiple postcodes.

4.  **"Done" Button Implementation:**
    *   **Requirement:** Add a green "Done" button below the "Search" button to close the dialog.
    *   **Resolution:** We ensured the `onOpenChange` prop was correctly passed to `frontend/src/pages/dialog-pages/EditLocationPage.tsx` (by modifying `frontend/src/components/settings-dialog.tsx`). Then, we added the "Done" button to `EditLocationPage.tsx` with the specified styling and functionality to close the dialog.

5.  **Postcode and Filter Default State Fixes:**
    *   **Issue 1:** The postcode input field defaulted to "5000" on a fresh load.
    *   **Issue 2:** Company filter buttons started in the red "off" state, rather than the white "on" state.
    *   **Resolution:** We modified `frontend/src/context/StoreSearchContext.tsx` to:
        *   Change the default `postcode` state to an empty string `''`.
        *   Initialize the `selectedCompanies` state with all available company names by default, ensuring all filters start in the "on" (white) state.

6.  **Max Radius Adjustment:**
    *   **Requirement:** Change the maximum radius for the search from 50km to 30km.
    *   **Resolution:** We modified `frontend/src/components/RadiusSlider.tsx` to change the default `max` prop value from 50 to 30.

**Pending Task:**
All discussed tasks have been completed. The system is awaiting further instructions.
