  Step 2: Application-Wide Provider Setup

   * Goal: Make the React Query client available to the entire React application tree.
   * File to Modify: C:\Users\ethan\coding\splitcart\frontend\src\main.tsx

       3. Create a single, application-wide instance of the query client: const queryClient = new QueryClient();.
       4. Wrap the existing <BrowserRouter> component with the <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>.
       5. Place the <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} /> component inside the provider. This will give us a powerful debugging
          tool to visualize the cache.
