The user initially asked to replicate a two-column FAQ section, consisting of an `FaqAccordion` and an image, from `HomePage.tsx` to `SubstitutionPage.tsx`.

I first read `HomePage.tsx` to understand the structure of the FAQ section. Then, I read `SubstitutionPage.tsx` to identify where to insert the new section and what imports were needed. I added the `AspectRatio` component and `kingKongImage` import, and inserted the FAQ section at the bottom of `SubstitutionPage.tsx`.

Next, the user asked to replicate the FAQ section on `FinalCartPage.tsx`. Upon reviewing `FinalCartPage.tsx`, I found that a similar FAQ section was already present. I informed the user about this existing section.

Finally, the user requested to update the `FaqAccordion` component in `SubstitutionPage.tsx` to display FAQs specific to the "substitutes" page. I changed the `page` prop of the `FaqAccordion` component from `"home"` to `"substitutes"` in `SubstitutionPage.tsx`.
