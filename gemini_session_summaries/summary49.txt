In this session, we focused on implementing and debugging the user registration functionality.

We started by resolving a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `allauth` package by installing it and configuring it in the Django settings. This led to fixing subsequent configuration issues, including adding the necessary middleware and including the registration URLs.

We then addressed several issues with the registration form itself. We corrected a password field mismatch between the frontend and backend and resolved a `ConnectionRefusedError` by setting up a console-based email backend for development. 

To improve the user experience, we implemented robust error handling. This included creating a custom exception handler to gracefully manage duplicate email registrations, preventing server errors and providing clear feedback to the user. We updated the frontend to display these specific error messages.

Finally, we made some UI improvements to the signup form by removing the 'Sign up with Google' button and adding a loading spinner to the 'Create Account' button to provide visual feedback during submission.
