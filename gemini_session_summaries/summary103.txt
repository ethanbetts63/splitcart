This session covered a wide range of frontend enhancements, backend refactoring, and data management improvements.

### Key Activities:

1.  **Pillar Page Development & Debugging:**
    *   Created definitions for multiple new pillar pages (e.g., "Pantry & International", "Eggs & Dairy", "Fruit, Veg & Spices") and added them to the `pillar_pages.jsonl` data file.
    *   Populated the `FAQ.jsonl` file with new content for several of the new pillar pages.
    *   Added the main `CategoryBar` component to the pillar page view so it appears on those pages.
    *   Debugged an issue where carousels were not appearing, which was traced back to the pillar page data not being linked to its constituent primary categories in the database.

2.  **Product Carousel & Tile Enhancements:**
    *   Restructured the `HomePage` to display a wide variety of product carousels in a specific layout.
    *   Implemented and then debugged a new backend sorting option (`carousel_default`) designed to show "bargains first" in carousels. An issue where results were incorrectly grouped by company was investigated, and after a few attempts at a fix, the issue was tabled for a later time. The API cache was also temporarily disabled as part of debugging.
    *   Fixed the "See More" button on carousels to correctly link to a search page when on a pillar page, instead of linking back to the pillar page itself.
    *   Resolved a UI bug on the `ProductTile` where multiple badges (bargain, size, per-unit price) would overlap by refactoring them into a single, vertically stacked flexbox container.
    *   Adjusted the bargain badge to show "-1%" instead of "-0%" when a price difference was very small.
    *   Made the "size" badge more robust by adding logic to parse array-like strings and display only the first element.

3.  **Price Comparison Chart Improvements:**
    *   Refactored the chart layout on pillar pages into a responsive two-column grid.
    *   Updated the chart title to be a dynamic, SEO-friendly question (e.g., "Is Eggs cheaper at...?").
    *   Added a plain-text summary sentence below the title to make the chart's conclusion more accessible.
    *   Added a "How We Compare" disclaimer card to the grid to explain the methodology.
    *   Applied styling to ensure all cards in the grid maintain a consistent height.
    *   Themed the chart bars according to company brand colors (Coles: Red, Woolworths: Green, Aldi/IGA: Black).

4.  **Backend & Data Management Refactoring:**
    *   Created a new `refine_primary_category` management command to provide a tool for manually cleaning up incorrect primary category assignments. This included creating a `category_exclusions.py` file to persist the corrections and updating the data generator to respect these exclusions.
    *   Fixed a bug in the `primary_cat_interface --unattached` command that caused it to skip categories.
    *   Consolidated the `update_price_comparisons` command into the main `generate` command under a `--price-comps` flag, cleaning up the project structure.
    *   Provided clarification on `git` commands, explaining how to correctly reset a single directory using `git checkout` instead of `git reset`.
