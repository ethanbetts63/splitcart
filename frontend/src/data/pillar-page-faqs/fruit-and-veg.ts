Aldi consistently wins Canstar blues fresh product award and is generally regarded online as being the best for customer satisfaction with regards to produce quality. However an honorouble mention would be IGA as IGA’s are often locally sourced they can find freshness and quality that the bigger companies cannot compete with."

    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'll sometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
