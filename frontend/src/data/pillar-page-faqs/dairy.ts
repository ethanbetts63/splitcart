    "question": "Is there a difference between home-brand milk and name-brand milk?",
    "answer": "For plain milk, there’s almost no practical difference. Blind taste tests show most people can’t tell them apart, and all milk sold in Australia has to meet the same legal standards for fat, protein, and safety. The main difference is price: home-brand milk is usually much cheaper, while name brands mainly offer niche variants (A2, lactose-free, added calcium). For everyday use, home-brand milk is basically the same product at a better price."

    "question": "Is Aldi’s cheese as good as Coles or Woolworths?",
    "answer": "It depends on the type of cheese. Aldi’s basic block cheeses and sliced cheeses are generally solid and offer great value, but they don’t always match the flavour depth of premium or branded options at Coles and Woolworths. For cooking or everyday sandwiches, Aldi is perfectly fine. For richer, specialty, or sharper cheeses, the big supermarkets’ branded options tend to win."

  {
    "question": "Does Aldi have a good dupe for Lurpak or Western Star?",
    "answer": "Yes — Aldi’s “Beautifully Butterfully” butter is widely considered one of the best supermarket dupes for premium butters like Lurpak and Western Star. In taste tests it ranks surprisingly close, especially for spreading and general cooking. It’s not identical, but it’s extremely good for the price and one of Aldi’s standout dairy products."

  {
    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'llsometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
