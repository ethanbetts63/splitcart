    "question": "How much cheaper is it to make your own granola?",
    "answer": "Homemade granola is typically 30–60% cheaper than store-bought versions from Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, or IGA. A simple batch using oats, nuts, seeds, and honey often costs $6–$10 per kilo, compared to packaged granolas that sell for $12–$20+ per kilo. You also control the sweetness, ingredients, and portion size."

    "question": "What is the cheapest possible breakfast?",
    "answer": "Across Australia’s major supermarkets — Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, and IGA — the consistently cheapest breakfast is rolled oats. A bowl made with water or milk usually costs 20–40 cents per serve, making it one of the best value meals you can buy. Peanut butter toast, eggs on toast, and homemade granola are also affordable, but oats almost always win on cost per serving."

    "question": "Is it cheaper to buy Asian sauces (soy, oyster, sriracha) at Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, or IGA compared to Asian grocers?",
    "answer": "Asian grocers are usually the cheapest place to buy staple sauces like soy, oyster, and sriracha — especially if you prefer larger bottles or authentic imported brands. Prices per 100ml are often noticeably lower, and the range is wider. Among the big supermarkets, Aldi can be surprisingly competitive, especially for home-brand soy and oyster sauce. Coles and Woolworths can match or beat Asian grocers when specials are running, but at full price they’re usually more expensive. IGA is the biggest wildcard: some stores are great, others are much pricier depending on location and supplier. If you want the lowest everyday price, Asian grocers generally win. For convenience or when Coles/Woolworths run good discounts, supermarkets can still be a strong option."

  {
    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'll sometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
