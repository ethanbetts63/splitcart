    "question": "Why have eggs gotten so expensive?",
    "answer": "Egg prices have surged primarily due to the ongoing crisis of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), or bird flu, which has necessitated the culling of millions of egg-laying hens, severely reducing the national supply. This supply crunch, compounded by persistent general food inflation and higher transportation costs, has driven prices up significantly. The industry also faces a long recovery time, as it takes nearly five months for replacement hens to mature and begin regular production."

    "question": "What’s the price difference between caged, barn-laid and free-range eggs?",
    "answer": "The difference in price directly reflects the complexity and cost of the production system. Caged eggs are the cheapest because they are the most space-efficient and cost-effective to produce. Barn-laid eggs are moderately more expensive than caged, as they require more space and labor, often leading to lower flock productivity. Free-range eggs are the most expensive, often costing 40% to 70% more than caged, due to the high costs associated with providing and maintaining outdoor access, higher land demands, and increased veterinary and labor requirements."

  {
    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'll sometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
