    "question": "Why don’t I see a “cheaper at Aldi” section above?",
    "answer": "To say that a product is cheaper at Aldi than at Coles or Woolworths, Aldi would need to actually have that product. Aldi stocks somewhere around 1/3 to 1/5 as many products as Coles and Woolworths, and it stocks a very unique range of products. This makes direct comparisons very rare. This is why we have a substitution system. It solves this exact problem to help you take advantage of Aldi's generally cheaper products."

    "question": "Is Aldi’s “Just Divine” chocolate a good dupe for Cadbury blocks?",
    "answer": "Aldi’s Just Divine chocolate is widely considered one of the closest supermarket dupes to Cadbury. The texture is smoother and slightly less creamy, but the flavour profile is surprisingly similar — especially in the milk chocolate and hazelnut varieties. I would even say it tastes better. The biggest difference is the price: Just Divine is often 30–50% cheaper per 100g than Cadbury at Coles and Woolworths. If you want the classic Cadbury sweetness without paying full-brand pricing, Just Divine is one of Aldi’s strongest value picks."

    "question": "What are the best Aldi dupes for popular snacks in Australia?",
    "answer": "Aldi is famous for creating low-cost versions of Australia’s favourite snacks, and many of them hold up surprisingly well. Some of the best-known dupes include their Biscotto biscuits (Tim Tam dupe), Sprinters chips (Smith’s/Kettle dupe), Just Divine chocolate (Cadbury dupe), Moser Roth (Lindt-style chocolate), and Meadows cookies (Coles/Woolworths bakery-style cookie dupe). These products usually cost noticeably less than the big brands, and while the flavour isn’t always identical, the value per gram is often unbeatable."

  {
    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'll sometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
