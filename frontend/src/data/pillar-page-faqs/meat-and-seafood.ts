    "question": "Is it cheaper to buy meat at a supermarket or butcher?",
    "answer": "It depends on the cut and the butcher. Common cheap cuts of meat are almost always cheaper at the big supermarkets but often a good local butcher will have more expensive cuts at a more competitive price. Not to mention a higher quality."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is it cheaper to buy a whole chicken and cut it up, or buy the pieces separately?",
    "answer": "It's considered on average to be around 30-50% cheaper to buy a full chicken. When you buy individual pieces such as the breast you are not just paying for the meat but also the labor required to separate and prepare the meat. On average 25-32% of a whole chicken is bone. But even this can be used to make stock or for flavor in soups."

    "question": "What is the cheapest meat per kilo in Australia?",
    "answer": "As of 2026 the cheapest per kilo price on meat was $3.45 per kg for chicken drumsticks in a bulk pack at aldi. Various other chicken pieces and a whole chicken can be as low as 4.20 - 4.50 per kg. Cheap Pork or beef sausages can be found for as little as $5.50 - $ per kilo. Cooking bacon can be found at 9 per kilo. Followed by corn beef silver side at 9.50 per kg. These two being the cheapest options for unprocessed boneless meat. Even factoring in that whole chickens and drumsticks are around 25 - 32% bone they are still significantly cheaper than any other option."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is meat expensive in Australia?",
    "answer": "Yes, meat is expensive in Australia. Australia is a major meat exporter, and high international demand drives up local prices as local consumers compete with overseas buyers. Additionally, the size of Australia adds significant transportation costs. Finally, strict regulations make it incredibly difficult for farmers and butchers to interact directly, necessitating a middle man that adds cost and creates a system more favorable to larger companies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you compare prices?",
    "answer": "Our price comparisons are based on all products shared by two companies in our system for a category. This 'product overlap' is why you'll sometimes see more items compared between companies like Coles and Woolworths then stores that have a more unique range, such as IGA or Aldi. Sometimes the range is so unique for a category that there is not enough product overlap to do a fair comparison. In such a case, we will omit the results entirely. Aldi, Coles and Woolworths generally have nationally consistant pricing but for IGA prices differ store to store, therefor we take the average price for IGA stores."
