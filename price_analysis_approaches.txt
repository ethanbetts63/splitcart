# Pricing Heatmap Analysis Approaches

This document outlines three potential approaches for creating a pricing heatmap to analyze the pricing strategies of different stores.

## Approach A: Percentage of Identically Priced Products

*   **What it measures:** The percentage of overlapping products between two stores that have the exact same price.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  Identify the set of common products between two stores.
    2.  For each common product, compare their latest prices.
    3.  Calculate the percentage of products with identical prices.

*   **Pros:** Simple to understand and implement. Provides a clear measure of price consistency.

*   **Cons:** Doesn't capture the magnitude of price differences. A product being off by $0.01 is treated the same as a product being off by $10.00.

## Approach B: Average Price Difference

*   **What it measures:** The average difference in price for overlapping products between two stores.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  Identify the set of common products.
    2.  For each common product, calculate the price difference (e.g., as a percentage or an absolute dollar amount).
    3.  Calculate the average of these differences.

*   **Pros:** Provides a measure of the magnitude of price differences, giving a better sense of how different the pricing is between two stores.

*   **Cons:** Can be skewed by a few products with very large price differences. The choice between percentage and absolute difference would need to be considered carefully.

## Approach C: Price Correlation

*   **What it measures:** The statistical correlation between the prices of overlapping products in two stores.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  Identify the set of common products.
    2.  Create two lists of prices for the common products, one for each store.
    3.  Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the two lists. A value close to 1 would mean that if a product is expensive in one store, it's also expensive in the other. A value close to 0 would mean there is no relationship between the prices.

*   **Pros:** A sophisticated statistical measure that can reveal if pricing strategies are aligned, even if the absolute prices are different.

*   **Cons:** More complex to implement and might be less intuitive to interpret than the other two approaches for some users.
